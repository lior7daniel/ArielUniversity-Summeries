Hi, 

to check either P_ID is exist or not, please follow:

1) use the makefile to compile the "check_pid.c" file by writting in the bash the command : "make".

2) run the file "a.out" by the command : "./a.out" and put up a PID number.
	
	Example: ./a.out <PIDnumber> 	--> 	./a.out 12345




Thanks,
Lior Daniel.
