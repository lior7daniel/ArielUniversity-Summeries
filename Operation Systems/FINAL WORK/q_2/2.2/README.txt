Hi, 

to test the server \ client , please follow:

1) use the makefile to run the server by writting the command : "make runServer".

2) use the makefile to compile the client by the command : "make compileClient".

3) run the "client" file and add the following details: pid number, signal number, number of signals.

	For example: "./client <pid> <sigNumber> <numberOfSignals>".




** Note: To see a run example, view the attached "q22.305257347.pdf" file. **




Thanks,
Lior Daniel.
