Hi, 

to use the dir_traversal.c file , please follow:

****** NOTE!!! ******* 

If the dir folder is not attached, the following commands should be written in the bash:

$ mkdir dir
$ touch dir/a dir/b
$ later ignored from the output
$ mkdir dir/sub
$ touch dir/sub/x

**********************

1) use the makefile to run the server by writting in bash the command : "make".

2) run the "a.out" file by the command: "./a.out".


Thanks,
Lior Daniel.
