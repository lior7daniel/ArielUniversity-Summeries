Hi, 

to use the set_policy file , please follow:

1) use the makefile to run the server by writting in bash the command : "make".

2) run the "a.out" file and add the following details: policy number, priority number.

	For example: "sudo ./a.out <policyNumber> <priorityNumber>".



** Note: you must run the 'a.out' file as administrator with 'sudo' command!!!**



Thanks,
Lior Daniel.
